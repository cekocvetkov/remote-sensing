# Full Stack Solution for Remote Sensing Object and Tree Detection
## Start the project locally:
`docker-compose up`

The docker-compose starts the frontend and all the needed components for the full-stack solution.
After all is successfully started one can access the frontend on `localhost:3000`

(one can add own geotiff images under tiny-py-local-stac/stac/images, before starting the docker containers, which will then be available for the whole application)
